TO AUTO BOOTSTRAP: 
- require in html
- register our module in app.js
	var app = angular.module('name', [dependencies])
- ng-app='name' to define the root of the app (ie - $rootScope); typically this is on html or body tag

- $scope is a JS object that template and controller both have access to!

- ng-class is used to conditionally control template element appearance
	ng-class="{ appearance: condition for appearance }"

- filters use | 
	<ng-repeat="flashCard in flashCards | orderBy: 'flashCard.question'">

- when filtering inside of an ng-repeat, just use property name by which to order, not obj.property
